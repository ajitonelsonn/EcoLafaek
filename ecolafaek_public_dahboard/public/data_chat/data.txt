__Inspiration
Living in Timor-Leste, I witness daily the struggle with waste management that affects our communities. In Dili, our capital city, over 300 tons of waste are generated every day, but more than 100 tons go uncollected. During the rainy season, this uncollected waste clogs our drainage systems, causing devastating floods in neighborhoods across the city.

Jica Survey

The inspiration came from seeing how technology can bridge the gap between public awareness and government action. Based on JICA survey data demonstrating the importance of public engagement in waste reporting, I envisioned a system where every citizen could become an environmental steward.

Waste Problem in Timor-Leste

From this hackathon, and as a holder of the PingCAP Certified TiDB Associate (PCTA) certification, I discovered the power of TiDB Cloud‚Äôs database, beyond simple reporting, we can build an intelligent system that learns from patterns, identifies hotspots, and delivers actionable insights for sustainable environmental management, while making it easy to store and manage our data in this powerful system. TiDB offers features like horizontal scalability, strong consistency and high availability using Raft-based replication, real-time analytics via HTAP (Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing), MySQL compatibility, cloud-native architecture, built-in vector & full-text search (in recent versions), and flexible deployment across multi-cloud or self-managed environments.

Deployment:

Production Environment: Deployed on AWS Lightsail with SSL encryption and automated backups
Real User Testing: Actually serving citizens in Timor-Leste for genuine impact measurement
__Challenges we ran into
Vector Database Learning Curve:
Initially, understanding how to effectively utilize TiDB's vector capabilities was challenging. Learning to optimize 1024-dimensional embeddings for both storage efficiency and query performance required extensive experimentation with different indexing strategies.

AI Model Integration:
Integrating Amazon Nova Pro with our workflow required careful prompt engineering to ensure consistent, structured responses. We had to implement robust retry mechanisms and error handling for API reliability in Timor-Leste's variable internet conditions.

Multi-Application Architecture:
Designing a single TiDB database to efficiently serve three different applications (mobile, dashboard, admin) while maintaining performance required careful query optimization and connection pooling strategies.

__Accomplishments that we're proud of
Real-World Impact:
EcoLafaek is more than just a hackathon demo; it's already live, implemented, and making an impact.
We've already tested the EcoLafaek mobile app for reporting waste issues, and it's working smoothly. Furthermore, our public dashboard is fully operational, reliable, and easily accessible, providing transparent insights into waste management in real time.

Technical Innovation:

Successfully implemented sophisticated vector database operations using TiDB's VECTOR(1024) columns
Built a true multi-step AI agent system that automatically progresses from citizen reports to government action
Achieved sub-second similarity search performance across thousands of vector embeddings
Created seamless integration between traditional SQL operations and vector similarity queries
Community Engagement:

Created an achievement and leaderboard system that motivates continued citizen participation
Community Leaderboard

Designed intuitive interfaces that enable non-technical users to contribute meaningfully to environmental monitoring
Built transparency through public dashboards that show community impact and government response
Environmental Contribution:

Addressing genuine sustainability challenges aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals
Providing data-driven insights for evidence-based environmental policy making
Empowering communities to take active roles in environmental protection
__What we learned
TiDB Database:
Working extensively with TiDB's vector capabilities taught us the power of combining traditional database operations with modern AI techniques. We learned how to optimize vector storage, implement efficient similarity search, and design schemas that support both relational and vector operations.

Multi-Step AI Architecture:
Building a system where AI agents automatically chain together taught us about designing robust, error-tolerant workflows. We learned to handle API rate limits, implement proper retry logic, and ensure system reliability in production environments.

Real-World Deployment Lessons:
Deploying in Timor-Leste taught us about optimizing for variable internet connectivity, diverse mobile device capabilities, and the importance of user education and community engagement in technology adoption.

Our Mission
EcoLafaek aims to address Timor-Leste's waste management challenges through innovative technology, community engagement, and data-driven decision-making.

Dili produces over 300 tons of waste daily, with more than 100 tons going uncollected. This waste clogs drainage systems, causing flooding and environmental damage.

Our vision is a cleaner Timor-Leste where communities are empowered to report waste issues, authorities have the data they need to prioritize cleanup efforts, and environmental health improves.
